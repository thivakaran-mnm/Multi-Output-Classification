# Multi-Output-Classification
## Overview
This project is aimed at predicting multiple binary labels based on a set of features. It involves preprocessing the data, training a multi-output classifier, making predictions on the test set, and creating a submission file.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- gensim

## File Descriptions
- **train.csv**: CSV file containing the training data.
- **test.csv**: CSV file containing the test data.
- **trainLabels.csv**: CSV file containing the labels for the training data.
- **Submission.csv**: CSV file containing the predictions for the test data.
- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Usage
1. Ensure all dependencies are installed.
2. Place the training and test data files (`train.csv`, `test.csv`, `trainLabels.csv`) in the appropriate directory.
3. Run the provided Python script or Jupyter Notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, make predictions, and create the submission file.
4. The submission file (`Submission.csv`) will be generated in the same directory.

## Data Preprocessing
- The training and test data are loaded from CSV files.
- Missing values in the data are filled with 'NA'.
- Categorical features are transformed using one-hot encoding.
- Text data is transformed using Bag of Words (BoW), TF-IDF, and Word2Vec embeddings.
- Numerical features are scaled using StandardScaler.

## Model Training
-Initialize Classifier.

-Train the classifier.

## Evaluation
The trained model is evaluated using the validation set.
Classification metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score are calculated for each label.

## Make predictions on the test data
predictions = model.predict(test_features)

## Save predictions to a CSV file
pd.DataFrame(predictions, columns=['Label']).to_csv('Submission.csv', index=False)
